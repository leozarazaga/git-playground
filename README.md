## About This Project

This repository is a fun space for us to practice and experiment with Git.

The idea is simple: each person can create something new whenever they like. We’ll pull each other’s work and create new branches, giving everyone the freedom to build whatever they want. This way, we can see what others have created and learn from each other.

Our goal? To `create`, `break`, and `rebuild` as we learn Git. Let’s see what we can build together!

## Learning Objectives

Our goal is to get better at Git. This project gives us the chance to:

- Understand the basics of version control.
- Learn key Git commands for code management.
- Explore branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
- Collaborate with others in real-world Git workflows.

- **Git installed** on your machine. (You can download it from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
